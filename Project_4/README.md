# INSTRUCTIONS

Before running any script, remember to change the location of python in all the files.  
Otherwise, they will not work.  

Just run `set_env.sh` in your terminal and follow the instructions.  
When it asks you wether you want to download the books, answer yes the first time.  
Once you have downloaded them, you can skip this part the next times you run the script.
